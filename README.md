These are the first programs I ever wrote, in high school on my TI-83
Plus graphing calculator during math class. I didn't know about StackOverflow,
so everything I learned was from the manual's documentation of TI-BASIC and
puzzling over problems I had. Also note that I had to write it in the
calculator itself, tiny 8x16 window and all.

I left the formatting as it is in my calculator, except that I lowercased the
variables, added comments, and added indentation. (Do you see that quadruple-
nested for-loop within a repeat?  How did I do that without tabs?)
